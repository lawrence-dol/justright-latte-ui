# Just-right Latte UI Theme

A minimal, subdued UI theme -- brown/gold on a medium-dark background. It is designed to be an elegant, clean look which is easy on the eyes and easy to read. At the same time, it needs to be sufficiently different from the code editor panel, while not being distracting from the editor content, allowing the editor window to remain the object of focus.

NB: This theme was forked from the (apparently abandoned) mount-autumn-ui theme due to a fault in the initialization code.
